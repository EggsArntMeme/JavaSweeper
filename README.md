# JavaSweeper
the repository for JavaSweeper, Minesweeper written entirely within JavaScript and makes a browser base Minesweeper!

CONTROLS:
rightclick or space (or clicking the large flag) - toggle 'flag mode'    (allows you to place down flags)
Middle Mouse Button - Refresh / restart
R - reveal all spaces    (was just used for testing lol) 


This was just made to practice my abilities with JavaScript and to teach myself more about the language.
Also just to make a game :3 

The code is a little weird, but it works :P   (hopefully ;-;) 

if there are any Errors, please tell me!   

Also a scoring system will be implemented as soon as I learn how o7
