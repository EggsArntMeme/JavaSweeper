# JavaSweeper
the repository for JavaSweeper, Minesweeper written entirely within JavaScript and makes a browser base Minesweeper!




This was just made to practice my abilities with JavaScript and to teach myself more about the language.
Also just to make a game :3 

The code is a little weird, but it works :P   (hopefully ;-;) 

if there are any Errors, please tell me!   

Also a scoring system will be implemented as soon as I learn how o7
